Dreambox.bundle.Testing ******** May work, may not work. PLEASE USE THE MASTER FOR THE MOST STABLE VERSION ********
===============

A Plex plugin to stream live TV from your Enigma 2 based receiver to your media device.

Installation Instructions
====================================


Put the Dreambox.bundle folder along with its contents in the plugins folder of your server and restart.
If you download the plugin via as a ZIP from Github you will have to change the folder name from 'Dreambox.bundle-master' #
to 'Dreambox.bundle'

Make sure that you enter preferences via the plugin interface and do not hard-code the values as it will not work.

If using Linux and Mac you will have to set the permissions of the folder to 755 ( chmod -R 755 ).

There seems to be a problem when updating from certain versions. A fix has been found on the forum, around page 22 until I get chance to add it to this readme
